This program is to warp an input image using inverse mapping from two different warp functions, 
with fixing the minification using adaptive supersampling and magnification problems using bilinear interpolation, 
display the input image and output image, and then optionally write out to an image file.
Users can select warp mode to decide methods taken to clean the warp and warp functions by command lines.

The warp in this program have one area where the image is being magnified and another is being minified.
Users can easily compare the differences between using different clean methods.

Usage: 
  warp input_image_name [output_image_name]
    -m mode selection: 0-4
    -w warp function selection: 0-1
  mode selection:
    1: general warp
    2: warp with clean method supersampling for minification
    3: warp with clean method adaptive supersampling for minification
    4: warp with clean method bilinear interpolation for magnification
    0: all clean warp (adaptive supersampling + bilinear interpolation)
    default mode: 0
  warp function selection:
    0: dr.house's warp function
    1: my warp function
