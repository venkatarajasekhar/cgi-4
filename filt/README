This program is used to filter an input image from a convolutional kernel read from a filter file
or a gabor filter kernel generated from parameters theta, sigma and period, 
and then optionally write out to an image file.

Usage: 
- Filter an image from a filter file and optionally write out to an image file
  filt <input_image_file> <filter_file> <output_image_file>(optional)
- Filter an image by Gabor filter generated from parameters and optionally write out to an image file
  filt <input_image_file> <output_image_file>(optional) -g <theta> <sigma> <period>

Mouse Response:
  Left click any of the displayed windows to quit the program.
