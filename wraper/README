This program can wrap an input image with matrix commands or mouse click corner positions, display original ans wrapped image, and optionally write out the image to an image file.

The program provide two types of wrap operation:
  Projective wrap - do translation, scale, shear, flip, rotation, perspective transformation with matrix commands
  Bilinear wrap - do bilinear transformation with matrix commands
  Interactive - let the user interactively position four corners of the output image in the output window with mouse click

Usage: 
wraper input_image_name [output_image_name] [mode]
default mode: projective mode
mode switch:
  -b          bilinear switch - do the bilinear warp instead of a perspective warp
  -i          interactive switch
matrix commands:
  r theta     counter clockwise rotation about image origin, theta in degrees
  s sx sy     scale (watch out for scale by 0!)
  t dx dy     translate
  f xf yf     flip - if xf = 1 flip horizontal, yf = 1 flip vertical
  h hx hy     shear
  p px py     perspective
  d           done

Mouse Response:
  In interactive mode, left click in the output window to position output image corners
Keyboard Response:
  Press q, Q or exit to quit the program.
