This program is to warp an input image and optionally write out to an image file.

Run warp to warp image.
  The output image size is decided by the warp function.
  The program provide two types of warp operation:
    mode 1 - stretch image: magnify the right side and minify the left side
    mode 2 - twirl image: increase the warp parameter to enhance image twirling
    mode 3 - magnifying glass effect
  The default mode is twirl image with warp parameter 2.
  -Usage: 
    warp input_image_name [output_image_name] [mode] [warp_parameter]
    [mode] = 1, 2, 3 (only mode 2 has a warp parameter)
  -Mouse Response:
    Left click any of the displayed windows to quit the program.
