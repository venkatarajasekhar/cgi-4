This program can warp an input image with matrix commands or mouse click corner positions, display original an warpped image, and optionally write out the image to an image file.

The program provide two types of warp operation:
  Projective warp - do translation, scale, shear, flip, rotation, perspective transformation with matrix commands
  Bilinear warp   - do bilinear transformation with matrix commands
  Interactive     - let the user interactively position four corners of the output image in the output window with mouse click
                    the output window for click is 1024x600 and then reshape the size after output image generation

Usage: 
warper input_image_name [output_image_name] [mode]
default mode: projective mode
mode switch:
  -b          bilinear switch - do the bilinear warp instead of a perspective warp
  -i          interactive switch
matrix commands:
  r theta     counter clockwise rotation about image origin, theta in degrees
  s sx sy     scale (watch out for scale by 0!)
  t dx dy     translate
  f xf yf     flip - if xf = 1 flip horizontal, yf = 1 flip vertical
  h hx hy     shear
  p px py     perspective
  d           done

Mouse Response:
  In interactive mode, left click in the output window to position output image corners
  Click order: (0, 0), (0, height), (width, height), (width, 0)
Keyboard Response:
  Press q, Q or exit to quit the program.
